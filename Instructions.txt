Open crontab text file and copy
run sudo crontab -e and paste in open spot
Edit the path with where your py file is located, the current path is within the source folder, the cron tab can be configured to update when you want
As for the update_log.txt, set the path to that as well to the text file provided as well, 
this is so that you can check the log by using "cat <update_log.txt path>"
ENJOY!
